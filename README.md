angular-payment-validation
==========================

Contains directives to allow validation and formatting of payment form fields. These directives are based on stripes jquery payments module except there is no reliance on receiving keypress event or the keydown event containing a keyCode.

This was written as a work around to the above events not being properly handled on Chrome for Android.
